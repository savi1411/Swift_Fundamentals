/*:
 ## Exercise - Types and Type Safety
 
 Declare two variables, one called `firstDecimal` and one called `secondDecimal`. Both should have decimal values. Look at both of their types by holding Option and clicking on the variable name.
 */
var firstDecimal = 1.0
var secondDecimal = 2.0


/*:
 Declare a variable called `trueOrFalse` and give it a boolean value. Try to assign it to `firstDecimal` like so: `firstDecimal = trueOrFalse`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
 */
let trueOrFalse = true
//firstDecimal = trueOrFalse
// Error


/*:
 Declare a variable and give it a string value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
 */
var texto = "String"
//texto = firstDecimal
// Erro


/*:
 Finally, declare a variable with a whole number value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Why won't this compile even though both variables are numbers? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
 */
var number = 1000
//firstDecimal = number
// Error - type safety / type inference
